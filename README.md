# AI-based-learning-solution
## Overview
This Flask application provides a Question-Answering (QnA) interface using the `valhalla/longformer-base-4096-finetuned-squadv1` model from Hugging Face Transformers. Users can ask questions based on the content of specific chapters, and the application will return answers extracted from the text using the Longformer model.

---

## Features
- **Chapter Management**:
  - Chapters are stored as text files and mapped to chapter names.
  - Dynamic loading and processing of chapters for QnA.
- **Question-Answering**:
  - Utilizes Hugging Face's Longformer model for contextual question answering.
- **Web Interface**:
  - Simple user interface for asking questions about chapter content.
  - Displays the chapter content, user questions, and answers on the same page.

---

## How It Works
1. **Model and Tokenizer Setup**:
   - Loads the Longformer model and tokenizer for handling long contexts effectively.
2. **QnA Functionality**:
   - A function `QnA` takes a question and a context (chapter content) as input, processes it through the model, and returns the extracted answer.
3. **Flask Routes**:
   - `/`: Displays an index page with available chapters.
   - `/chapter/<name>`: Loads the content of the specified chapter, allows users to submit questions, and returns answers.
